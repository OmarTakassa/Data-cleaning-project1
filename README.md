# Data-cleaning-project1
## Overview

In this project, I demonstrate **how to clean data** from a table called `layoffs` using **PostgreSQL**.  

Real-world data is often messy, inconsistent, or incomplete. Cleaning it is a **crucial step** before any analysis, reporting, or machine learning tasks.  

This project focuses on:  

- **Removing duplicates**  
- **Standardizing text fields**  
- **Converting data types**  
- **Handling null or inconsistent values**  

With proper cleaning, the `layoffs` table becomes **consistent, reliable, and ready for analysis**.

## Why Data Cleaning Matters 

Messy data can lead to:  

- ❌ Wrong insights or decisions  
- ❌ Errors in analysis or reports  
- ❌ Wasted time on debugging and fixing issues  

Cleaning your data ensures **accuracy, reliability, and efficiency**, making it a foundational step in **data analysis and data science**.

## Key Highlights

- Simple and **safe workflow** using PostgreSQL  
- Real-world focus on **common data issues**  
- Step-by-step approach for **practical learning**  
- Ideal for anyone learning **SQL-based data cleaning**

## Tech Stack 

- **PostgreSQL** – Database engine  
- **SQL** – Queries and data manipulation
